## The BioChemical Library (BCL)

Introduction
------------

The BioChemical Library (BCL) is an open-source software package distributed under the permissive MIT license. Historically, it was developed to 
provide a broad array of unique tools for biological and chemical research, such as small molecule modeling, protein structure determination from 
sparse experimental data, machine learning, predictive modeling, and a broad array of cheminformatics tools. 

With respect to biological modeling, the BCL contains the widely used secondary structure prediction program JUFO, a folding algorithm that 
assembles secondary structure elements, and loop construction tools that complete protein backbones. With this series of protocols the BCL allows 
construction of backbone models for large and membrane proteins from the primary sequence. Among its unique strengths are the incorporation of sparse 
and low resolution data into folding simulations.

With respect to cheminformatics, the BCL was written with with an emphasis on atom-level manipulation of molecules and strong support for graph 
comparisons, descriptor calculation, and quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling (QSAR). The BCL also contains a number of standard 
machine learning algorithms coded in C/C++ for the purposes of QSAR, including deep neural networks (DNN). 

In recent years, the Rosetta software package has made substantial gains in protein structural modeling with and without experimental constraints. 
As of 2021, the deep learning algorithms AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold have fundamentally transformed protein structure prediction, making many 
of the early biology tools of the BCL obsolete. Moreover, the maturation of deep learning over the last decade in multiple areas of scientific 
investigation has resulted in an explosion of machine learning modalities available in general purpose software packages, such as TensorFlow 
and PyTorch. Thus, the addition of new machine learning algorithms into the BCL source code is no longer a priority as it was a decade ago. 
Instead, we are excited to embrace the open-source spirit of today's software communities as we work to integrate complementary software packges 
into the BCL, and vice versa.

Today, original code development in the BCL is primarily in the realm of small molecule drug design, cheminformatics, and enhanced user experience. 
This includes algorithms for reaction- and non-reaction-based design, molecule optimization routines, pharmacophore mapping, small molecule conformer 
generation, and interface code to increase interoperability with other software packages. We are also actively exploring creation of a graphical user 
interface (GUI) and accessibility of the BCL through a Python API. The most important thing to note, however, is the scope of the BCL is largely 
defined by the developers working on it, as well as ongoing changes to needs in the broader computer-aided drug discovery community.

The BCL is comprised of over one thousand classes organized in 42 namespaces with approximately 600,000 lines of code that form a collection of C++ 
algorithms developed since 2005. The original code that formed the foundation of the BCL was written by one of the original co-creators of the 
Rosetta macromolecular modeling software suite, Jens Meiler, and since then has been an academic project in the Meiler Lab at Vanderbilt University 
for graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and scientific programmers. We are excited to take the next step and make the BCL openly available. 
It is our hope that this will both expand the user-base and contributor-based, as well as inject new ideas into the community. 

More Information
------------

If you plan to compile the BCL source code instead of using any of the available binaries, read COMPILING.md for detailed instructions.

If you wish to contribute to the BCL code base, please read through CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and CONTRIBUTING.md beforehand. Discussions about new 
features, bug fixes and documentaion are held in the 'Issues' tab under the BCL GitHub (https://github.com/BCLCommons/bcl). All other discussions 
are held in the 'Discussions' tab on the BCL GitHub.
